Introduction
------------

Themosis does not have an own wrapper around the WP_Query or it's own ORM. Instead it gives you al the freedom to implement your models in a way which fits best for your project. 



Themosis framework comes with a basic system of models.

A model will store the methods/functions that manipulate your data. You can perform actions to retrieve data from your WordPress database using WordPress core functions or you can perform actions to update those data.

Basic models
------------

Register a Model
-----------------

In order to create a model, simply create a new PHP class inside the `resources/models` directory. Here is an example of a model class that comes by default with the framework:

```php
<?php

// This file is stored in 'resources/models/PostModel.php'

class PostModel
{
	/**
	 * Return a list of all published posts.
	 * 
	 * @return array
	*/
	public static function all()
	{
		$query = new WP_Query([
            'post_type'         => 'post',
            'posts_per_page'    => -1,
            'post_status'       => 'publish'
        ]);

        return $query->get_posts();
	}
}

?>
```
By default, model classes are loaded using the PSR-4 standard and are setup without any namespaces.

If you want to add directories to autoload custom classes or add namespaces to your existing models, use the `loading.config.php` file stored inside the `resources/config` directory of your `themosis-theme`:

```php
<?php

return [

    /*
    * Edit this file in order to configure your theme's
    * classes autoloading. Classes are loaded using PSR-4.
    *
    * The key is the namespace and key's value contains one or more paths to your classes.
    */
    ''  => [themosis_path('theme').'controllers', themosis_path('theme').'models']

];
```

The function `themosis_path('theme')` returns the theme `resources` folder path. More information about the `themosis_path` function in the [Helpers guide](http://framework.themosis.com/docs/helpers/).

Basic usage
-----------

In order to use your model, simply create a new instance anywhere in your code or if you used static methods, only call your method. Using the above example code, we can retrieve all the `posts` for our view like so:

```php
Route::get('home', function()
{
	return View::make('pages.home', [
		'posts' => PostModel::all()
	]);
});
```


Using eloquent as ORM
---------------------

> Store your `model` classes in the `resources/models` directory.
